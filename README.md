# pentest.toolbox
This toolbox is a beginner friendly repository for pentesters that are looking for interesting and useful scripts to learn or to apply. It containts scrips like:
* Nmap scanning
* Generating  a stronger password
* Bruteforce 
* Email finder through Hunter.io



# Nmap Scan Script
This Python script Nmap.py allows you to perform network scans using Nmap directly from your Python environment. It utilizes the subprocess module to execute Nmap commands and retrieve scan results.

 ## How to use:
1. clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine through typing: git clone https://github.com/Subhaniths/pentest.toolbox

2. Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file Nmap.py.

3. Run the Script: Execute the script by providing the target IP address and port range as arguments. For example:

- python3 Nmap.py 192.168.0.1 1-1000

4. Replace 192.168.0.1 with the IP address you want to scan, and 1-1000 with the range of ports you want to scan.

5.  View Results: The script will display the Nmap scan results in the terminal.

# Company Email Finder
This script utilizes the Hunter API to search for email addresses associated with a given company name. This is useful for pentesters to find out what format a company uses for their email addresses + find usernames. 

## Requirments
Before using this script, you need to sign up for an account on Hunter and obtain an API key. Replace the provided API in the script with your actual Hunter API key.

## Usage 
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Open the script in a text editor and replace the API key with your actual Hunter API key.
3. Run the script using Python.
4. Enter the name of the company for which you want to search for email addresses when prompted.
5.  The script will make a request to the Hunter API and display any email addresses found associated with the provided company name.

# Stronger Password Generator
This Python script enhances the strength of a given password by adding numbers and additional random letters. It can be useful for improving the security of your passwords and making it harder for attackers to bruteforce. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required.

## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the passwordhelper.py file.
- Navigate to the directory containing the file.


## Run the script using Python:

1. python3  passwordhelper.py
2.  Enter your desired password when prompted.
3.  The script will generate a stronger version of your password by adding numbers and additional random letters.
4. The stronger password will be displayed on the console.
- Example
Suppose you have the following password: examplepassword
 Running the script will generate a stronger password like:
* examplePassword5HkZuRq

# Brute Force Password Generator and Cracker

## Description
This Python script generates a random password and then attempts to brute-force it. It uses a combination of lowercase alphabets and a specified character length to generate a random password. Then, it estimates the time required to brute-force the password based on the first character and the length of the password. Finally, it iterates through all possible combinations to find the password.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tqdm library (`pip install tqdm`)

## Usage
1. Run the script (`python brute_force.py`).
2. The script will generate a random password and attempt to brute-force it.
3. It will display the password being brute-forced and the result once it's found.
4. The script provides an estimate of the time required to brute-force the password based on the length of the password.

## Example
```bash
$ python brute_force.py
Attempting to brute force abcdef
